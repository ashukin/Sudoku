# SUDOKU: CHALLENGE YOUR BRAIN CELLS! 

## OVERVIEW
The objective of this assignment is to generate any number of sudoku puzzles and also their corresponding solvers. While solving a sudoku board, the goal is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the sudoku board(also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.  Also there should be no repitition of numbers in a row, column and grid. 

In the program code, all the functions are defined before the main driver code. 1)When the user runs the program, he/she needs to input the level of the sudoku puzzle generated. 2)A sudoku is generated and given to the user to be provided. 3)Next the user is asked if he/she wants to review the solution. If the user inputs 'yes', the solution of the board is printed. This is how the code is executed.
Proper comments are done in the code.
ENJOY!!

## REQUIREMENTS
